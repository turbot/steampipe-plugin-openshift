# Table: openshift_user

A user is an entity that interacts with the OpenShift Container Platform API. These can be a developer for developing applications or an administrator for managing the cluster. Users can be assigned to groups, which sets the permissions applied to all the groupâ€™s members. For example, you can give API access to a group, which gives all members of the group API access.
